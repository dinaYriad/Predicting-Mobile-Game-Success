The oldest known form of the game is shown in a painting from the tomb of Hesy (circa 2686-2613 BCE). Many pictures of the game and artifacts have been discovered and are displayed in Museums around the world. The commonness of these finds indicates that the game was very popular in its time.\n\nThe main adversaries in Senet are the Spools and the Pyramids. These pawns follow a path from their start positions to the House of Horus in an inverted 'S'. The player moving all of his pawns off the board first wins. Fields on the Senet board are called houses. Some of these have special significance and are adorned with icons like the Ankh symbol. Instead of dice flattened sticks are used. Each stick has a bright side and a dark side. Every bright side is a point. If only dark sides are showing the player is awarded 5 points. When a 1, 4, or 5 is thrown the player gets another turn.\n\nWhen moving into a field occupied by an opponent, the pieces switch places. If, however, the opponent's pawn is part of a row of two or more, it cannot be beaten. It is possible to 'jump' over an opponent if it isn't part of a row of 3 pieces or more. 3 pieces are considered a block and are an important strategic tool.\n\nThrough symbology Senet hints at the afterlife as seen from an Egyptian point of view. If one's piece is beaten on one of the last three fields or the jump over the House of Water is not successful one moves back to the house of Rebirth. In such the game alludes to reincarnation and the journey of the dead.\n\nSenet Deluxe is a truly unique strategy game. It features great animation, a soundtrack, an intelligent adversary, enforceable backwards moves, highlighting for acceptable moves, game statistics and online help. Be prepared to spend many hours with the most popular game of the antiquity.\n\nFor more screenshots and several videos of the application in action, please visit the website indicated below.""",RoGame Software,4+,"DA, NL, EN, FR, DE, EL, IT, JA, KO, NO, PT, RU, ZH, ES, SV",34689024,Games,"Games, Strategy, Board, Education",18-07-08,22-07-18

But be careful, the cost of borrowing in this world can be very high so you'll need to know the cost of goods to keep ahead of those interest charges\u2026\n\nTo make progress you'll need to aim high. Borrow as much as you can get but only when you know what you\u2019re going to buy and that you're getting a good price.

It's not about the war game or any other shooter games, its literally about painting the ball. There is a given pattern of colored balls and some pipes around them. You are given an amount of paint color to draw and change the color of any of the balls in the scene trying to match 3, 4 or 5 balls near a pipe, this way the pipes suck these matched balls and new paint is given to you. The gameplay is very different from the well known and cloned match 3 swapping candy fluffy games like candy crush soda and candy crush saga games. Try it and you'll get hooked.\n\n\u2022 Game Objective:\nYou have to make groups of 3 or more balls of the same color. These groups must be made next to a pipe. Paint balls by tapping on them. When you click on the ball you wish to paint, the ball changes color and the group gets sucked into the pipe.\n\n\u2022 Tips:\nUsing the same pipe makes it hot. If a pipe becomes extra hot the balls are transformed into multi-color which gives you extra points & life. Letters appear on some balls. When balls are grouped, the letter taken, complete the word 'PaintBall' on the bottom. When all word is completed a big bonus is earned!\n\n\u2022 Hard: The Hard game works exactly like the Easy game, but you have to play fast because your paint reserve is dripping! If it runs out, you lose.\n\u2022 Panic: In Panic mode you have 100 sec. to score as much as possible. This is not all! Your paint reserve is dripping & there are no black balls. This makes it easier to make groups.\n\u2022 Heat: In this mode, ball groups are taken only when they are next to a hot (red) pipe. Each time this happens active (red) pipes are moved. There are no black balls, which makes it easier to make groups. This mode needs planning!\n\u2022 Chroma: In the Chroma mode you will have to play using color combinations e.g.: if you have yellow paint & the ball you want to paint is blue. Blue and yellow will be: Green. Use the color wheel to keep track. If you mix opposite colors you get black.\n\nFEATURES\n* award winning gameplay\n* hours of gameplay craziness - mania guaranteed\n* many modes to play\n* fast playing ideal for waiting rooms/buses\n* Export Hi-Scores to internet\n* change ball styles\n\nPRESS:\n-----\nUIQ 2008 Open Winner for the games category! \n-----\ngamefreaks365: So, do you need Paintball 2?

The levels are filled with dirt which can be tunneled through simply by moving through it. This creates empty space. Emerald and diamonds can be collected by moving into them. Diamonds are with 3x as Emeralds.  Rocks and gems can rest on dirt, walls (only indestructible and magic walls), or other rocks and gems, but once these are removed, they will fall down. This is sometimes useful, as you can drop things on top of monsters roaming the levels. Some destroyed monsters drop gems necessary to achieve the necessary number to complete the level.  Or they may drop other pieces, such as explosives or keys to help you solve the puzzles.  Or control the wind direction.  There are dozens of creatures to interact with.  Crystal Mine is a fun and challenging game and comes with many of the levels created by Emerald Mine Cub members over the past 20+ years.\n\nPlease note that this game is extremely challenging and some levels will take many attempts before they can be solved.",Modular Dreams Inc,4+,EN,2818386,Games,"Games, Casual, Strategy",03-05-09,03-05-09

There is no troublesome saving or loading \u2013 just end the game (by pressing the home button on the iPhone) and start exactly where you left off next time you turn it on.\n\nPebbles is flexible!\nPebbles has got everything: from a quick game here and there to tricky challenges.\n\nThe easier levels don\u2019t require too much sweat; however, they are not trivial and still a lot of fun. The higher levels of difficulty get pretty tricky, though. Just the right thing when you\u2019re in the mood to get that gray matter working. \n\nPebbles is pretty and sounds cute!\nWhat\u2019s more, Pebbles is supported by adorable visual effects (three pebble designs to choose from) and the cutest sounds.\n\n\nHow does Pebbles work?\n\nThe basic principle of the game is irresistibly easy: from the edge, you throw a pebble into a square playing field. When one stone lands on another of the same color, this stone as well as all bordering stones of the same color disappear. The goal is, of course, to empty the field \u2013 so far, so good.  \n\nYet, this simple concept leads to surprisingly challenging functions, and the variety of strategic possibilities make Pebbles an absorbing game. \n\nA shelf above the playing field shows which stone is going to come next. Knowing which stone is going to follow is a deciding factor in the game\u2019s strategy. \n\nChoosing the sequence of the moves with care is also very important: a well positioned pebble can do more than just eliminate others; it can also be the basis for up coming moves, just as a badly positioned pebble can prove to be terribly obstructive.  \n\nThe level of difficulty increases with the number of pebbles that are in the playing field at the start of a game as well as the number of different colors.",Objective Development,4+,"EN, DE",10136576,Games,"Games, Strategy, Board, Entertainment",28-04-09,20-01-16
